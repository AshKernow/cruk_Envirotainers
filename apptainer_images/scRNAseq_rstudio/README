Build a container with RStudio server and various packages needed for single
cell RNA-seq analysis. The container is based on the rocker/rstudio image.

# 1. Gather list of R packages to install

This comes in part from the scRNAseq course, plus some additional software that
has been requested by users (e.g. Seurat) and some that I've used (e.g.
velociraptor).

--> scRNAseqPackages.txt

# 2. Modify the Dockerfile to install the software

* modify the rocker/rstudio version to match the version of R that is required.
* modify the Bioconductor version to match the version of R that is required.
* Add any new packages.

```
./xrAddPackagesToDockerFile.R
```
--> Dockerfile2

* Check and then rename the Dockerfile2 to Dockerfile.

# 3. Build the Docker image

```
version=4.5.0
sudo docker build -t scrnaseq_rstudio:v${version} .
```

# 3. Build the Singularity image

```
version=4.5.0
sudo singularity build rstudio_scRNAseq_${version}.sif docker-daemon://scrnaseq_rstudio:v${version}
```
--> rstudio_scRNAseq_4.5.0.sif

# 4. Check package installation

Just check all the packages are installed.

```
singularity exec rstudio_scRNAseq_4.5.0.sif ./xrCheckPackages.R 
```

# 5. Test the image

Copy the server test directory to the scratch space

```
cp rstudio_scRNAseq_4.5.0.sif rstudio_server_test/rs_images/.
cp -pvr rstudio_server_test ~/CScratch/.
```

use `rstudio-server.sh` to start the server and test it.
